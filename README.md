## Description

- Motivation: My motivation for this program was to create a react application that was going to be used as my portfolio for my future employees
- Goal: I built this project to see my understanding of react and to also create a portfolio for employers to look at and see my prospects to be a possible employee
- Problems Solved: It solves having employeers have a hard time finding my skills for there workplace
- What I Learned: i learned how display grid works and components in react, i also used css variabls for the first time and it made it much easier to change my styling overall i believe this project if anything enhanced my css knowleadge more then react becasue the react portion was much simpler and css can just go on forever.
